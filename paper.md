# Introduction
This is nonsense. But it is my nonsense.

Nonsense is clearly nonsense (Doe et al 3000).

Monster et al (1372) have researched nonsense thoroughly, though no authors have since looked at the nonsense of research paper titles.

A large uncertainty in nonsense is the extent to which it can be measured.

Adding more info about background.

Now Eve is added, we can delve into this with simulations.

# Simulations
These are some simulations.

# Methodology
I used methods X, Y and Z. (Smith 2022)
The final results were verified using a scanning mobility hypergraph.

# Results 
Simulations indicate that I don't really know what I'm doing.
